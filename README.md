CAR PARKING SYSTEM
There is a sensor at the parking system entry that is activated when a car approaches. A password is required to unlock the gate after the sensor is activated. The gate would open to allow the car entry if the password is entered correctly. If not, the gate remains locked. The door will be locked and require the arriving automobile to input passwords if the departure sensor detects that the present car is leaving the parking lot and another car arrives.

IMPLEMENTATION ON BOARD-
CORRECT PASSWORD- 
When we entered the correct password and the entrance sensor was on, then a green light was displayed, indicating that the car can enter the parking lot. 

WRONG PASSWORD-
When we entered the wrong password and the entrance sensor was on, then a red light was displayed, indicating that the car cannot enter the parking lot. 

RESET- 
The output was getting updated only when we toggled the reset switch.
